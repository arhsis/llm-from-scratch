# LLM From Scratch

This repository documents my personal journey in learning about large language models (LLMs) from scratch. Please note that I have only a basic understanding of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).

## Goal

The ultimate goal is to stay updated with current research on *LLM Systems*, with a focus on the system aspects rather than the LLM itself.

However, you should first understand how LLMs work before delving into the system of LLMs, right?
